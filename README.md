# bluemc
BlueMC - A 3D sandbox voxel-based video game similar to Minecraft that I am making from scratch with the Nim programming language and the nimgl library. I am using OpenGL and GLFW.

## How to install (not finsihed yet)
Use git to clone the repository or download the .zip file and extract the files. Make sure you have Nim installed. In the terminal, cd into the folder and run `nimble install` to install or just `nimble build` to compile.
